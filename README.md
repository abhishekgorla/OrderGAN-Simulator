This repository includes code for creating historical order datasets, training a GAN model to mimic order distributions, generating synthetic orders for future scenarios, and computing key fraud metrics (fraud rate, false positives, incorrect cancellations, and account takeover rate) to support risk assessment for new payment product launches.
